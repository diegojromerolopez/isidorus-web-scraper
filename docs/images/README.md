## Design Concept

The logo is inspired by medieval religious iconography and illuminated manuscripts, specifically the traditional depictions of Isidore of Seville as a saint and scholar. The design creates a striking anachronism by placing modern technology in a medieval context:

1. **Medieval Iconography**: 
   - Traditional bishop's vestments with mitre and halo
   - Ornate decorative border typical of illuminated manuscripts
   - Rich color palette of golds and blues used in medieval art
   - Latin inscription in the style of medieval manuscripts

2. **Modern Technology**:
   - Laptop computer replacing ancient books
   - Holographic displays showing code and network graphs
   - Circuit board patterns integrated into the decorative elements
   - Web browser windows and data visualizations

3. **Symbolism**: 
   - Bridges 7th-century scholarship with 21st-century web scraping
   - Honors Isidore's mission to collect and organize all knowledge
   - Shows technology as a continuation of ancient scholarly traditions
   - The "Digital Codex" represents the modern equivalent of the *Etymologiae*

## Color Palette

- **Primary Blue**: `#336791` (PostgreSQL blue - represents database/data storage)
- **Accent Gold**: `#D4AF37` (Represents ancient wisdom and knowledge)
- **Background**: Transparent or white

## Usage Guidelines

- Maintain aspect ratio when resizing
